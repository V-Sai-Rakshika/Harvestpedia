## Overview

Harvestpedia is a front-end web application that serves as a reference platform for plant-based foods. Users can browse fruits and vegetables, read nutritional data, compare up to 5 items side by side with interactive charts, explore seasonal picks, and generate AI-powered recipes from ingredients they have on hand.

The project is built entirely with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — no frameworks, no build tools — making it fast, lightweight, and easy to extend.

## Getting Started

Harvestpedia is a static site. No build step required.

### Option 1 — Open directly
```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/V-Sai-Rakshika/harvestpedia.git
cd harvestpedia

# Open in browser
open index.html
```

### Option 2 — Local server (recommended for API features)
```bash
# Using Python
python -m http.server 8000

# Using Node.js (npx)
npx serve .

# Then open
http://localhost:8000
```

---

## API Setup

The AI Recipe Generator uses the Anthropic Claude API through a lightweight proxy (`js/api.js`).

1. Get an API key from [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com)
2. Set up a proxy server or use Anthropic's direct API
3. Update `js/api.js` with your endpoint

> **Note:** Never expose your API key directly in client-side JavaScript in production. Use a server-side proxy.
